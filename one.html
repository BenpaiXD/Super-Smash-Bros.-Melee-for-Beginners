        <p>Super Smash Bros is one of Nintendo’s flagship video game franchises which has seen a release on each of Nintendo’s consoles since the series debut in 1999 on the Nintendo 64.  The series was conceived by Japanese video game developer, Masahiro Sakurai, who was looking to create a 4-player 2D fighting game using Nintendo’s most iconic characters.  Much to his surprise, Nintendo green lit his project, beginning the franchise which would end up becoming the most ambitious video game cross over in history. </p>

        <p style="margin-top:60px">The first game, Super Smash Bros. Often referred to as Smash 64 released to critical acclaim, loved by serious and casual players alike.  While it may have been the cast of loved characters that drew people in, it was the wholly unique gameplay and mechanics kept them in. In most 2D fighting games, the goal is for the players to damage each other, in order to deplete the opponent’s health down to 0.  In Smash Bros, by hitting your opponent you increase their knockback, represented by a percentage at the bottom of the screen and the win condition is instead to knock your opponent clear off the screen.  This change, set Smash far apart from standard fighting games. It made the gameplay much more dynamic, allowing players to string hits together however they felt, instead of memorizing multiple button combinations.  Players would focus much more on, spacing, stage positioning, and overall movement, which created a much more enjoyable experience not just for the players, but for the spectators as well. </p>

        <p>While Smash 64 brought much to the table, setting the foundation for the future of the series, it was Melee, Smash’s GameCube release, where franchise unlocked its full potential.  Super Smash Bros. Melee, referred to as Melee, had a rough early development.  After the release of Smash 64, the team at HAL Labs was tasked with completing melee in just 13 months. However, the resulting final product, is what many consider to be an accidental masterpiece.  Compare to its predecessor, Melee is a much faster game, faster movement, attacks and combos allow for gameplay at lightning-fast speed. It also gave the player absolute control over their character which let people truly express themselves through their gameplay, instantly cementing it as the fan favourite game.  But due to the rushed development, there were a number of gameplay oversights, oversights which allowed players to gain a competitive edge over their opponent. This combined with melee’s already fast gameplay turned an already good game into a masterpiece. </p>
